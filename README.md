# LocalBody-of-Nepal
This is an api for list of all local bodies of Nepal, aligned with their respective districts and province.
The data I got in this api is by web scraping so the data mayn't be 100% correct.
Basically, you can send a POST request of your preferred type of data(You'll understand more in documentation later.) and the get the required data.
